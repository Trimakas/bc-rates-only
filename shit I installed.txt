first I followed this!!

https://mkdev.me/en/posts/rails-5-vue-js-how-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-frontend

to install yarn I did this
npm install -g yarn

and then made the changes according to the above site.

but I also had to do these steps:
wow, had to create /config/webpack/custom.js and the stuff in it for this shit to work..
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      vue$: 'vue/dist/vue.esm.js'
    }
  }
}


AND had to update /config/webpack/environment.js otherwise the shit won't fucking work!
const { environment } = require('@rails/webpacker')
const vue =  require('./loaders/vue')
const customConfig = require('./custom')

environment.config.set('resolve.extensions', ['.foo', '.bar'])
environment.config.set('output.filename', '[name].js')

// Merge custom config
environment.config.merge(customConfig)

// Delete a property
environment.config.delete('output.chunkFilename')

environment.loaders.append('vue', vue)
module.exports = environment

Your config/application.rb has the following line:
config.active_record.raise_in_transactional_callbacks = true
comment that shit out

THIS IS HOW YOU START WEBPACK!!!
./bin/webpack-dev-server

lastly install these
yarn add vuetify --save
yarn add axios --save
yarn add vuelidate --save
